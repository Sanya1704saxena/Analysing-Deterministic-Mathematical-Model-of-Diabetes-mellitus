# Analyzing Deterministic Mathematical Model of Diabetes Mellitus
This repository contains the research project conducted by Group 6 for the M.Sc. Statistics and Data Science program at SVKMâ€™s NMIMS, under the guidance of Dr. Debasmita Mukherjee. The project focuses on developing a deterministic mathematical model to analyze Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), examining how various physiological and demographic factors interact to impact disease progression.

## Project Overview
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels, primarily due to insulin resistance or insufficiency. This study models interactions between key variables, such as glucose, insulin, cholesterol levels, and BMI, to provide insights into T2DM dynamics. The approach integrates mathematical modeling, data visualization, and regression analysis to explore the relationships between these factors and to identify the main contributors to diabetes progression.

## Methodology
Mathematical Modeling: Utilizing Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), we modeled the dynamics of glucose, insulin, BMI, and cholesterol levels in the context of T2DM.
Data Visualization: We employed box plots, scatter plots, and radar plots to visualize data trends and relationships across different diabetes classes (non-diabetic, prediabetic, diabetic).
Regression Analysis: Linear regression and multinomial logistic regression helped identify the most influential features affecting diabetes classification.
## Key Findings
Significant Predictors: HbA1c, BMI, and VLDL levels emerged as strong predictors of diabetes classification.
Age & Gender Trends: The likelihood of diabetes increased with age, with significant demographic differences across classes.
Model Validation: The model achieved high accuracy in classification, particularly for diabetic cases.
## Tools and Libraries
Python (SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Statistical and machine learning techniques for data analysis and modeling
## Future Scope
Future work could involve refining the dataset and exploring additional clinical parameters to improve model accuracy and stability. Enhanced cross-validation and testing with diverse datasets are also recommended.
